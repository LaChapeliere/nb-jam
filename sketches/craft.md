## Potion characteristics
A potion is described by [where in the gender space you are] + [fluidity] + [the two most important things that create your gender feeling] + [modifiers]

### Gender space
Two variables: man - woman
WHAT ABOUT OTHER GENDERS?

total = 0: "No need for a gender when you're agender."
total = 1: "Feels like a [man/woman], maybe, if you squint."
total = 2: all of the same gender: "You're a [man/woman], but it's like, not very important."
total = 3, all of the same gender: "No question asked, you're a [man/woman]."
total >= 4, all of the same gender: "[Man/Woman], that's you, and there's no place for much else in your identity."

man = 1, woman = 1: "Little bit of this, little bit of that, a good mix of agender, woman and man."
man = 1, woman = 2-3: "Non-binary, leaning more toward being a woman."
man = 2-3, woman = 1: "Non-binary, leaning more toward being a man."
man = 2-3, women = 2-3: "You identify strongly both as a man and a woman."
man = 1, woman = 4: "A very dominant woman identity, with a sprinkle of man."
man = 4, woman = 1: "A very dominant man identity, with a sprinkle of woman."

### Fluidity
fluidity: How variable your gender is
0: "Very stable."
1-2: "The exact feeling shifts slowly over time."
3: "It varies from day to day."
4+: "It changes so fast that it gives you whiplash."

### Important things to your gender feeling
The two highest non-null values between body, lang, express and social.
"The most affirming aspects of your gender are"
body: "feeling like your body aligns with your personal image"
lang: "hearing the correct language used to describe you"
express: "being able to express your gender however it makes sense to to you"
social: "being perceived in a specific way"

### Modifiers
Text about pronouns/labels, body dysphoria/euphoria, gender expression.
